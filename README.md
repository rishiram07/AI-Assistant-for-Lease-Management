# AI-Assistant-for-Lease-Management
This project implements an AI-powered assistant leveraging OpenAI's GPT and other integrations to provide intelligent querying capabilities for lease management.
It uses Streamlit as the frontend interface and integrates with Pinecone Vector Database, Cohere Embeddings, and Google Generative AI to deliver precise and efficient responses to user queries.
Frontend:
Built using Streamlit for an interactive, user-friendly chat interface.
Allows users to input questions and view responses in real-time.
AI Query System:
OpenAI GPT Integration: Processes natural language queries.
Conversational Retrieval Chain: Combines LLM output with vector-based retrieval for contextually accurate answers.
Cohere Embeddings: Ensures effective data representation in vector space.
Database Integration:
Pinecone Vector Store: Stores and retrieves domain-specific knowledge efficiently.
Configured for high-performance similarity search with embeddings.
Backend Logic:
Chat history management to maintain context across multiple queries.
Customizable prompts for consistent, structured responses.
